This is intended to be a url-shortener.  Gonna try to give it my own twist though.
I know there's a ton out there already.

Feel free to work on it. Fork and/or download, check out the dependencies in package.json to see what you
need, then run npm --install.  Make it work good, shoot me some feedback, etc.
